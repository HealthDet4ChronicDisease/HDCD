This script requires `numpy`, `pandas`, and `geopandas` within
the Python environment you are running this in.

The class accepts Pandas DataFrames and zip files of geoJSON.
The class consists of functions:
    * load_geoshapes

    * merge_geoshapes_counties_zip
    * zip_socioeconomic
    * merge_county_socioeconomic
