# Functional Specification

## Background
Health outcomes are influenced by many factors, including genetics, behavior, and social factors. Existing research identified many factors of behavior, such as smoking, drinking, unhealthy diet, and exercise to be associated with health outcomes. Additionally, social determinants of health (SDOH) have become an increasingly growing area of research for the health community. A compelling body of work has shown that social factors play important roles in health outcomes. For example, multiple studies have demonstrated a stepwise gradient pattern in the association between income and health - health improves incrementally as income rises. However, the association between SDOH and health outcomes can be complicated, as there are many complex biopsychosocial and biophysiosocial pathways and processes.

To explore and analyze such complex relationships, interactive visualizations can aid researchers and public health experts in "knowledge discovery, hypotheses generation, and decision support." [[1]](#1)[[2]](#2) Interactively visuzliations can play an important role in fostering knowledge generation and help in establishing associations and causality, as they allow for direct data manipulation and analysis. However, creating interactive visualizations can be a technically intensive and arduous task, requiring both technical and data visualization experience. We would like to make this process as easy as possible so that a user with minimal technical experience can create and utilize the interactive visualizations.

## User Profile
1. The user is a public health official who is interested in public health data and wants to gain hands-on experience working with public datasets. They want to use the tool for  basic visualizations, summary statistics, and/or simple association studies. They can use the inferences made based on the tool to support their policy proposal, as well as bring attention to new health issues and trends. Their skill set should comprise of domain knowledge about public health.

2. The user is a data scientist who specializes in public health. They want to perform analysis on public datasets to support their own research and explore mechanisms that link SDOH and health outcomes. They have strong technical skills in a few programming languages and expertise in data analysis and data visualization.

3. The user is a medical doctor interested in exploratory analysis of SDOH to identify trends and associated health outcomes longitudinally to form hypotheses for a grant application. The doctor would be using these data as supportive materials for said grant application.

## Data Sources
For demonstration purposes, we collected data from different sources, including a publicly available Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) dataset, [Chronic Disease Index (CDI)](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/Chronic-Disease-Indicators/U-S-Chronic-Disease-Indicators-CDI-/g4ie-h725/data) and [500 PLACES](https://www.cdc.gov/places/about/500-cities-2016-2019/index.html), and also protected data from the *All of Us Research Program*.

As we envision an interactive visualization tool to be widely applicable, we opted to use the *All of Us Research Program*, an effort by the National Institues of Health (NIH) that consists of a diverse group of at least one million participants across the United States. [[3]](#3) This data consortium includes health questionnaires, electronic health records, digital health technology data, and biospecimens. Importantly, it also includes key SDOH, such as income, education, and housing status.

Researchers can gain access to the *All of Us Research Program* through the [All of Us Research Hub](https://www.researchallofus.org/). Some limitations of this dataset is that it requires training to gain approval for the controlled-tier dataset, which includes participant-level location data. Also, any analysis and visualization must be performed within the *All of Us Research Hub* workbench. Data cannot be exported locally.

## Use Cases

**1.What is the trend of binge drinking actions across the United states? How does that different across each state in the US?**
- The user is expected to explore the variables in the dataset and use the `plot_longitudinal_change` function to visualize the change of rate or credence. The goal is to identify new patterns and formulate questions and/or hypotheses. When the user does not have a specific region of interest to start, users can try the `plot_geomap` function and select variables of interest to visualize the distributional differences across the US.
- We expect the user to utilize these interactive visualization tools for exploratory analysis and identify key variables of interest to formulate research questions and hypotheses.

**2. What is associated with this [personal behavior], such as binge drinking, and what are some potential outcome of [personal behavior]?**
- The user is expected to perform simple association analyses and utilize the `plot_corr` function to examine the correlation between variables of interest and outcomes. This is a crucial, first step to establishing association between variables and outcomes. The association between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk was revealed in this way.
- We expect the user to explore variables of interest and potential outcomes using the `plot_corr` function and stratify the data to identify new patterns, and formalize insightful hypotheses.

**3. What is the distribution of homelessness within the greater Seattle area and is there an association to mental health disorders?**
- The objective of this user interaction is to have the user create and interact with a geomap, consisting of interactive legends for housing status and various mental health disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder).
- We expect the user to pan and zoom the geomap, hide and show different levels of housing status with the interactive legends, and draw conclusions based on the various levels of data they choose to hide and show.

**4. Is there a trend in obesity stratified by income and county within the greater Seattle area?**
- The objective of this user interaction is to have the user create and interact with time series graphs with interactive legends for income and/or a geomap, consisting of a sliding scale for time (in years).
- We expect the user to hide and show different levels of income on the time-series graphs and interact with the sliding scale on the geomap to draw conclusions based on the various levels of data they choose to hide and show. They may choose to show the time-series graphs and geomap side-by-side.
