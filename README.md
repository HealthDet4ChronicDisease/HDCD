# Health Data Analysis for Chronic Diseases
This project is in fulfillment of the final delieverable for the CSE 583 course at University of Washington.

## Objective
Our goal for this project is to deploy interactive visualizations with a focus on social determinants of health (SDOH), which can vary in their distribution across space and time. The question we posit is: *"Can we identify emerging trends?"*
