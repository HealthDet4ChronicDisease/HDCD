# Health Data Analysis for Chronic Diseases
This project is in fulfillment of the final delieverable for the CSE 583 course at University of Washington.

## Background
Social determinants of health are "societal systems, their components, and the social resources and hazards for health that societal systems control and distribute, allocate and withhold, such that the demographic distribution or trend of health outcomes is changed." [[1]](#1) These systems include governments, insitutions, and other organizations, which control, allocate, withhold, and distribute resources and hazards for health. Some of these are: food, sanitation, education, health information, and law and justice.

### Dataset

## Objective
Our goal for this project is to deploy interactive visualizations with a focus on social determinants of health (SDOH), which can vary in their distribution across space and time, and their associations with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. The question we posit is: *"Can we identify emerging trends?"*
