# Health Data Analysis for Chronic Diseases
This project is in fulfillment of the final delieverable for the CSE 583 course at University of Washington.

## Objective
Our goal for this project is to deploy interactive visualizations with a focus on social determinants of health (SDOH), which can vary in their distribution across space and time, and their associations with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. The question we posit is: *"Can we identify emerging trends?"*
