# Health Data Analysis for Chronic Diseases
This project is in fulfillment of the final delieverable for the CSE 583 course at University of Washington.

## Background
Social determinants of health are "societal systems, their components, and the social resources and hazards for health that societal systems control and distribute, allocate and withhold, such that the demographic distribution or trend of health outcomes is changed." [[1]](#1) These systems include governments, insitutions, and other organizations, which control, allocate, withhold, and distribute resources and hazards for health. Some of these are: food, income, employment, education, and health information.

SDOH have become an increasingly growing area of research for the health community. A compelling body of work has shown that social factors play important roles in health outcomes. Multiple studies have demonstrated a stepwise gradient pattern in the association between income and health - health improves incrementally as income rises. However, the association between SDOH and health outcomes can be complicated, as there are many complex biopsychosocial and biophysiosocial pathways and processes. [[2]](#2)

To explore and analyze such complex relationships, interactive visualizations can aid researchers and public health experts in "knowledge discovery, hypotheses generation, and decision support." [[3]](#3)[[4]](#4) Interactively visuzliations can play an important role in fostering knowledge generation and help in establishing associations and causality, as they allow for direct data manipulation and analysis.

### Dataset

## Objective
Our goal for this project is to deploy interactive visualizations with a focus on social determinants of health (SDOH), which can vary in their distribution across space and time, and their associations with chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease. The question we posit is: *"Can we identify emerging trends?"*
